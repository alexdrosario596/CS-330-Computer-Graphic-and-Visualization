How do I approach designing software?
    What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
    What design process did you follow for your project work?
    How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
    
Some new design skills that I acquired after working on this project are:
Customizing and adding shapes to form objects in OpenGL.
Understanding of OpenGL format.
Became more familiar with Visual Studio.
Testing
In the design process, I first try to understand the requirements of the project I will be working on. I gather information such as: Who the users are? What are their needs?, and What problem does it solve? I then conduct some research and analysis. I start by analyzing existing solutions and seeing what aspects can be improved and innovated. I then start to create ideas about aspects specific to my program. This can be things like UI and specific functions required for the program to run efficiently. I then put my thoughts into action and start designing the UI and/or coding. I receive feedback from professors and implement their ideas to my work.
In future work I shall continue to prioritize user needs and feedback. By doing this, I think about the others involved in the project and refrain from implementing only what I feel is suitable. 




How do I approach developing programs?
    What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
    How did iteration factor into your development?
    How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you      to the 
    projectâ€™s completion?
    
New development strategies that I used in my 3D scene include:
Using libraries and frameworks specific to 3D graphics.
Continuously testing the output of my code to determine if it was a good fit for the project.
Created code for lighting, textures, rendering, etc.
Use of rotating, scaling, and positioning techniques.
Iteration allowed me to view my project with multiple different POVs. Everytime I added, removed or adjusted something in the code I would get feedback from the output. You sometimes get a different view on your work and can use these new ideas to your advantage. It also allowed me to continuously improve the project. 
Constantly working on the milestones allowed me to familiarize myself with OpenGL and even more with Visual Studio. I was able to add to my project bit by bit and focus on these bits one at a time. 



    
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
    How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in 
    your future educational pathway?
    How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in 
    your future professional pathway?

If I get the opportunity to work in another class with similar projects, I will be more prepared to take on the challenge. Using the knowledge I have gained from this project I feel more confident in creating a logo or scene for an employer or customer.
